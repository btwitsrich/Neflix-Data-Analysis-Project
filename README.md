Netflix Data Analysis Project – From Raw Data to Insights 🎬📊

Excited to share my latest project where I explored and analyzed a Netflix dataset to uncover some interesting insights! 🎉

🔍 Project Highlights:

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset by handling missing values, formatting dates, and standardizing content categories.

🧾 Data Transformation: Structured the data for deeper exploration and analysis.

📊 Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to uncover trends in content type, release years, genres, and more!


💡 Some key insights I discovered:

How the content catalog has evolved over time

The dominance of certain genres in specific years

Country-wise content distribution trends

📌 This project helped me improve my skills in:

Data Cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

I'm passionate about turning data into decisions—and this was another step forward on that journey!

📁 Would love to connect with others working on similar projects or exploring data science. Let's grow together! 🌱
